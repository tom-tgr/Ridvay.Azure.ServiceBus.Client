#Ridvay.Azure.Function.TriggerRedirects

Description: Ridvay.Azure.Function.TriggerRedirects is a lightweight library designed to seamlessly redirect Azure Function events to Azure Service Bus messages. The main goal of this library is to simplify and streamline the process of integrating Azure Functions with Azure Service Bus, reducing the need for manual configuration and custom implementations.

Currently, the library supports Timer Trigger events, allowing developers to redirect timer-based function triggers to Azure Service Bus messages with minimal effort. Future updates may include support for additional Azure Function triggers.

Key features:

Easy integration with Azure Functions and Azure Service Bus
Timer Trigger support for automated event redirection
Simplifies the development process and reduces boilerplate code
Extendable for future Azure Function trigger types
